        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In geology, eduction is a process in which the Earth's crust spreads sideways, exposing deep-seated rocks.[citation needed]

            It is prominent in the middle layers of the Himalayas, where gravity pushes the mountains down. Together with a high grade of erosion, this activity brings deep rocks to the surface, many from more than a depth of 100 km. The unusually fast elevation preserves rare metastable minerals, e.g. diamonds and coesite.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Various formal fallacies have been described. They are invalid forms of deductive reasoning.[18][14] An additional aspect of them is that they appear to be valid on some occasions or on the first impression. They may thereby seduce people into accepting and committing them.[22] One type of formal fallacy is affirming the consequent, as in "if John is a bachelor, then he is male; John is male; therefore, John is a bachelor".[23] This is similar to the valid rule of inference named modus ponens, but the second premise and the conclusion are switched around, which is why it is invalid.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Deductivism is a philosophical position that gives primacy to deductive reasoning or arguments over their non-deductive counterparts.[60][61] It is often understood as the evaluative claim that only deductive inferences are good or correct inferences. This theory would have wide-reaching consequences for various fields since it implies that the rules of deduction are "the only acceptable standard of evidence".[60] This way, the rationality or correctness of the different forms of inductive reasoning is denied.[61][62] Some forms of deductivism express this in terms of degrees of reasonableness or probability. Inductive inferences are usually seen as providing a certain degree of support for their conclusion: they make it more likely that their conclusion is true. Deductivism states that such inferences are not rational: the premises either ensure their conclusion, as in deductive reasoning, or they do not provide any support at all.</p>
